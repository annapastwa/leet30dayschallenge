# Number Complement
# Given a positive integer, output its complement number.
# The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
# Note:
# The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
# You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
# This question is the same as 1009: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/
